       "'China issued licenses to auto makers on Thursday that allow self-driving vehicles to be road tested for the first time, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported. Two licenses were offered to Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, and the other went to electric vehicle start-up NIO, Xinhua reported. NIO confirmed it received a license. There was no immediate comment from SAIC. The licenses would allow operators to test drive the vehicles on a 5.6-km (3.5-mile) public road in Jiading District of Shanghai, Xinhua said. The licenses were issued after Robin Li, the boss of China\\'s biggest search engine Baidu, tested his firm\\'s driverless car on Beijing\\'s roads in July, stirring controversy as there were no rules for such a test, the agency said. NIO said it had received its license from Shanghai Municipal Government. \"We will now be able to further the development of our autonomous driving technologies,\" NIO Co-Founder and President Lihong Qin said in the statement.

       "'China issued licenses to auto makers on Thursday that allow self-driving vehicles to be road tested for the first time, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported. Two licenses were offered to Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, and the other went to electric vehicle start-up NIO, Xinhua reported. NIO confirmed it received a license. There was no immediate comment from SAIC. The licenses would allow operators to test drive the vehicles on a 5.6-km (3.5-mile) public road in Jiading District of Shanghai, Xinhua said. The licenses were issued after Robin Li, the boss of China\\'s biggest search engine Baidu, tested his firm\\'s driverless car on Beijing\\'s roads in July, stirring controversy as there were no rules for such a test, the agency said. NIO said it had received its license from Shanghai Municipal Government. \"We will now be able to further the development of our autonomous driving technologies,\" NIO Co-Founder and President Lihong Qin said in the statement.

       "'The company is partnering with Domino\\'s Pizza and others to see how consumers react. DETROIT — Ford Motor Co. is making Miami-Dade County its new test area for self-driving vehicles. The automaker and its partners – Domino’s Pizza, ride-hailing company Lyft and delivery company Postmates – are starting pilot programs to see how consumers react to autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Self-driving startup and Ford partner Argo AI already has a fleet of cars in the area making the highly detailed maps that are necessary for self-driving. Ford also will establish its first-ever autonomous vehicle terminal in Miami, where it will learn how to service and deploy its test fleet. More services will likely be introduced as the partnership goes on, including Chariot, an app-based shuttle service owned by Ford. It’s all part of Ford’s effort to find viable business models for fully autonomous vehicles and get them on the road by 2021. “This is, I think, the future of any automotive company or mobility company. If a majority of the world’s population is going to be living in cities, we need to understand how to move those people around,” said John Kwant, Ford’s vice president of city solutions, who inked the deal with Miami-Dade. Ford isn’t the first automaker to run test fleets of autonomous vehicles. General Motors Co. will start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City this year, while Nissan Motor Co. is launching an autonomous taxi service in Yokohama, Japan, next week. Technology companies like Waymo – a division of Google – are also testing self-driving vehicles on public roads in Phoenix, San Francisco and Singapore, among other cities. But the partnership with a specific metropolitan area is less common. Both sides envision a deep relationship where Ford can help Miami-Dade solve specific problems, like how to most efficiently move people from its suburbs to its downtown monorail, and Miami-Dade can offer solutions like dedicated lanes for automated vehicles or infrastructure projects like advanced traffic lights that can send signals to connected cars. “We want to be on the forefront of this because we want to give our people choices,” said Carlos Gimenez, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, which is home to 34 cities and 2.7 million people. Sherif Marakby, Ford’s vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, says the company also intends to work closely with local businesses. The company wants to learn, for example, how a florist might use an autonomous delivery vehicle. “Autonomous vehicle technology is interesting, but it’s a whole lot more interesting with a viable business model,” he said. The city of Miami is the fifth-most congested in the U.S., according to a recent traffic study by the consulting firm Inrix. After more than a century of selling people vehicles, Kwant says Ford now wants to figure out ways to move people more efficiently in order to cut down on that time in traffic. Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst with the consulting firm Navigant Research, says Ford and others must figure out how to make money on self-driving cars. “If this does take off, if people do adopt automated vehicles and use them for ride-hailing, that’s going to result in a decline in retail vehicle sales,” Abuelsamid said. “They need to figure out, if we’re going to have a decline in the number of vehicles we sell to consumers, how do we keep our business stable?” Kwant says the testing will also help Ford determine what its future self-driving vehicles need to look like and how they must perform. “If you don’t have steering wheels, how do you begin to use that package space? How do you begin to look different in terms of carrying more people?” he said. Ford won’t say how many vehicles it will have on the road in Miami-Dade, but says it will be Ford’s largest test area for autonomous vehicles by the end of this year. All of the vehicles will have backup safety drivers. Domino’s experimental vehicles aren’t even technically autonomous; they’re equipped to be, but for now they have actual drivers. The windows are blacked out so customers can experience how to get pizza from the car without dealing with a person. Miami will give Ford new challenges. Previously, it tested Domino’s cars in suburban Michigan, where parking wasn’t an issue. But in busy Miami Beach, the cars will have to figure out where they can go to allow apartment-dwellers to safely retrieve their pizzas. An autonomous delivery vehicle from Postmates might have to switch between Spanish and English commands when it picks up a meal and delivers it to a customer. Self-driving Lyft vehicles will be tasked with mapping out the best places to wait for customers without causing more traffic headaches. Kwant says Ford will announce more city partnerships as this year progresses. But Miami-Dade was a natural, since it has good weather, lots of different urban and suburban terrain and support from Gimenez and other government leaders. Gimenez, who began talking to Ford in 2017 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, says he’s not worried about consumer acceptance of self-driving cars. He thinks his community will embrace them as companies prove that shared autonomous vehicles can be cheaper and safer than regular ones. Gimenez says self-driving vehicles also can potentially improve traffic flow without significant new investments in roadways. They can travel more closely together, for example, because they’re always watching the car in front of them and can brake automatically.”That’s why I’m really high on this technology,” he said. var mediaContent = \"media\\\\\\\\:content,content\"; (function() { var now = new Date(); var cookieName = new RegExp(\\'MSPAN_Paywall_views_\\' + now.getMonth()); window.MSPAN = { Paywall: { totalViews: function() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(\\'; \\'); var val = 0; if (!cookieName.test(document.cookie)) { return 0; } for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { if (cookieName.test(cookies[i])) { val = parseInt(cookies[i].split(\\'=\\')[1]); } } return val; } } }; }()); (function(){ \"use strict\"; if(/logout/.test(window.location.search)){ var date = new Date(); var cookieString = \"MSPAN_Paywall_user=0; domain=.\"+document.location.host.replace(/^\\\\w+\\\\./, \\'\\')+\"; path=/; expires=\" + date.toGMTString(); var cookieString2 = \"MSPAN_Paywall_user=0; domain=\"+document.location.host+\"; path=/; expires=\" + date.toGMTString(); date.setHours(date.getHours() - 1); document.cookie = cookieString; document.cookie = cookieString2; } }());'"

       "'Shortly after an autonomous car struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona, one of GM\\'s self-driving cars was handed a ticket after police said the vehicle got too close to a pedestrian while making a right turn. The car is owned by the San Francisco-based startup, Cruise Automation, and was formally cited for failing to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk. Cruise says that car\\'s data shows the person was far away enough from the vehicle for it to be a non-issue, and that the car did nothing wrong. According to KPIX-TV, a witness said the cop was just writing a regular ticket like normal. Data collected by Cruise shows the pedestrian was 10.8 feet away from the self-driving car as it turned onto Harrison at 14th Street on one of the car\\'s normal test routes. In a statement, the company said, \"Safety is our priority in testing our self-driving vehicles. California law requires the vehicle to yield the right of way to pedestrians, allowing them to proceed undisturbed and unhurried without fear of interference of their safe passage through an intersection. Our data indicates that\\'s what happened here.\" Despite the car operating itself, Cruise says the human test driver is now responsible for the citation, even though it believes neither the car nor its supervisor did anything wrong. Discussions surrounding autonomous cars and their interactions with pedestrians have reached a fever pitch in the last week following the death of 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg after she was struck and killed by one of Uber\\'s self-driving Volvos as she walked her bicycle across a road in Temple, Arizona.'"

      "China issued licenses to auto makers on Thursday that allow self-driving vehicles to be road tested for the first time, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported. Two licenses were offered to Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, and the other went to electric vehicle start-up NIO, Xinhua reported. NIO confirmed it received a license. There was no immediate comment from SAIC. The licenses would allow operators to test drive the vehicles on a 5.6-km (3.5-mile) public road in Jiading District of Shanghai, Xinhua said. The licenses were issued after Robin Li, the boss of China's biggest search engine Baidu, tested his firm's driverless car on Beijing's roads in July, stirring controversy as there were no rules for such a test, the agency said. NIO said it had received its license from Shanghai Municipal Government. \"We will now be able to further the development of our autonomous driving technologies,\" NIO Co-Founder and President Lihong Qin said in the statement.

       "'The company is partnering with Domino\\'s Pizza and others to see how consumers react. DETROIT — Ford Motor Co. is making Miami-Dade County its new test area for self-driving vehicles. The automaker and its partners – Domino’s Pizza, ride-hailing company Lyft and delivery company Postmates – are starting pilot programs to see how consumers react to autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Self-driving startup and Ford partner Argo AI already has a fleet of cars in the area making the highly detailed maps that are necessary for self-driving. Ford also will establish its first-ever autonomous vehicle terminal in Miami, where it will learn how to service and deploy its test fleet. More services will likely be introduced as the partnership goes on, including Chariot, an app-based shuttle service owned by Ford. It’s all part of Ford’s effort to find viable business models for fully autonomous vehicles and get them on the road by 2021. “This is, I think, the future of any automotive company or mobility company. If a majority of the world’s population is going to be living in cities, we need to understand how to move those people around,” said John Kwant, Ford’s vice president of city solutions, who inked the deal with Miami-Dade. Ford isn’t the first automaker to run test fleets of autonomous vehicles. General Motors Co. will start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City this year, while Nissan Motor Co. is launching an autonomous taxi service in Yokohama, Japan, next week. Technology companies like Waymo – a division of Google – are also testing self-driving vehicles on public roads in Phoenix, San Francisco and Singapore, among other cities. But the partnership with a specific metropolitan area is less common. Both sides envision a deep relationship where Ford can help Miami-Dade solve specific problems, like how to most efficiently move people from its suburbs to its downtown monorail, and Miami-Dade can offer solutions like dedicated lanes for automated vehicles or infrastructure projects like advanced traffic lights that can send signals to connected cars. “We want to be on the forefront of this because we want to give our people choices,” said Carlos Gimenez, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, which is home to 34 cities and 2.7 million people. Sherif Marakby, Ford’s vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, says the company also intends to work closely with local businesses. The company wants to learn, for example, how a florist might use an autonomous delivery vehicle. “Autonomous vehicle technology is interesting, but it’s a whole lot more interesting with a viable business model,” he said. The city of Miami is the fifth-most congested in the U.S., according to a recent traffic study by the consulting firm Inrix. After more than a century of selling people vehicles, Kwant says Ford now wants to figure out ways to move people more efficiently in order to cut down on that time in traffic. Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst with the consulting firm Navigant Research, says Ford and others must figure out how to make money on self-driving cars. “If this does take off, if people do adopt automated vehicles and use them for ride-hailing, that’s going to result in a decline in retail vehicle sales,” Abuelsamid said. “They need to figure out, if we’re going to have a decline in the number of vehicles we sell to consumers, how do we keep our business stable?” Kwant says the testing will also help Ford determine what its future self-driving vehicles need to look like and how they must perform. “If you don’t have steering wheels, how do you begin to use that package space? How do you begin to look different in terms of carrying more people?” he said. Ford won’t say how many vehicles it will have on the road in Miami-Dade, but says it will be Ford’s largest test area for autonomous vehicles by the end of this year. All of the vehicles will have backup safety drivers. Domino’s experimental vehicles aren’t even technically autonomous; they’re equipped to be, but for now they have actual drivers. The windows are blacked out so customers can experience how to get pizza from the car without dealing with a person. Miami will give Ford new challenges. Previously, it tested Domino’s cars in suburban Michigan, where parking wasn’t an issue. But in busy Miami Beach, the cars will have to figure out where they can go to allow apartment-dwellers to safely retrieve their pizzas. An autonomous delivery vehicle from Postmates might have to switch between Spanish and English commands when it picks up a meal and delivers it to a customer. Self-driving Lyft vehicles will be tasked with mapping out the best places to wait for customers without causing more traffic headaches. Kwant says Ford will announce more city partnerships as this year progresses. But Miami-Dade was a natural, since it has good weather, lots of different urban and suburban terrain and support from Gimenez and other government leaders. Gimenez, who began talking to Ford in 2017 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, says he’s not worried about consumer acceptance of self-driving cars. He thinks his community will embrace them as companies prove that shared autonomous vehicles can be cheaper and safer than regular ones. Gimenez says self-driving vehicles also can potentially improve traffic flow without significant new investments in roadways. They can travel more closely together, for example, because they’re always watching the car in front of them and can brake automatically.”That’s why I’m really high on this technology,” he said. var mediaContent = \"media\\\\\\\\:content,content\"; (function() { var now = new Date(); var cookieName = new RegExp(\\'MSPAN_Paywall_views_\\' + now.getMonth()); window.MSPAN = { Paywall: { totalViews: function() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(\\'; \\'); var val = 0; if (!cookieName.test(document.cookie)) { return 0; } for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { if (cookieName.test(cookies[i])) { val = parseInt(cookies[i].split(\\'=\\')[1]); } } return val; } } }; }()); (function(){ \"use strict\"; if(/logout/.test(window.location.search)){ var date = new Date(); var cookieString = \"MSPAN_Paywall_user=0; domain=.\"+document.location.host.replace(/^\\\\w+\\\\./, \\'\\')+\"; path=/; expires=\" + date.toGMTString(); var cookieString2 = \"MSPAN_Paywall_user=0; domain=\"+document.location.host+\"; path=/; expires=\" + date.toGMTString(); date.setHours(date.getHours() - 1); document.cookie = cookieString; document.cookie = cookieString2; } }());'"

BERLIN, March 15 (Reuters) - The Chinese government is evaluating a German law that lays the groundwork for use of self-driving cars, and will likely adopt some of the German rules, a legal expert said on Thursday. Eric Hilgendorf, who teaches law at the University of Wuerzburg and served on the German government\\'s ethics commission on automated driving, said he had been invited to China in the coming weeks to present information about the law. Hilgendorf, who will give three lectures at the Renmin University of China Law School and hold high-level meetings about the new legislation, said China had adopted a great deal of German criminal and civil law, albeit with some tweaks, and he expected similar action in this case. \"Especially when it comes to technical issues, they\\'re often ready to adopt large sections of our law,\" he told Reuters after a speech at an Aspen Institute conference on artificial intelligence. German carmakers could benefit if China adopted similar laws and guidelines on the issue, Hilgendorf said, noting it would mean fewer modifications for exports to China. Carmakers around the world are teaming up with technology companies in areas such as machine learning and mapping as they race against Silicon Valley companies such as Google, Tesla and Apple to develop autonomous vehicles. Both industries see huge potential revenues in the market for autonomous vehicles, which could be available for wide use in just two years. But it remains unclear how many drivers will be ready to give up control, and many countries must still put laws in place to allow self-driving cars to hit the road. Germany last year paved the way for testing self-driving cars with a law that requires a driver to be sitting behind the wheel at all times ready to take back control if prompted to do so by the vehicle. German carmakers, Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW, have all invested heavily in the technology. The new legislation allows them to road-test vehicles in which drivers will be allowed to take their hands off the wheel and their eyes off the road to browse the web or check e-mails while the vehicle handles steering or braking autonomously. Hilgendorf was part of the government-appointed committee that drew up the world\\'s first ethics guidelines for the field of autonomous cars, including a requirement for the software that controls them to be programmed to avoid injury or death of people at all cost.
